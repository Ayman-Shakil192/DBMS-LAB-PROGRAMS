1) Add the required constraints on the created tables.

CREATE TABLE SUPPLIER
(
	SID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	SNAME VARCHAR(100),
	ADDRESS VARCHAR(100),
	PRIMARY KEY (SID)
);

CREATE TABLE PART
(
	PID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	PNAME VARCHAR(100),
	COLOR VARCHAR(100),
	PRIMARY KEY (PID)
);

CREATE TABLE CATALOG
(
	SID INT,
	PID INT,
	COST REAL,
	FOREIGN KEY (SID) REFERENCES SUPPLIER (SID) ON DELETE CASCADE,
	FOREIGN KEY (PID) REFERENCES PART (PID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

2) Populate the relations with at least 5 tuples each.

INSERT INTO SUPPLIER(SNAME,ADDRESS) VALUES
('RAHUL','BANGLORE'),
('SHASHANK','DELHI'),
('AJAY','MUMBAI'),
('JESSICA','JAIPUR'),
('ROHIT','BANGLORE');

INSERT INTO PART(PNAME,COLOR) VALUES
('PART1','GREEN'),
('PART2','RED'),
('PART3','BLUE'),
('PART4','GREEN'),
('PART5','RED');

INSERT INTO CATALOG(SID,PID,COST) VALUES
(1,1,4500),
(2,2,3000),
(3,3,5000),
(4,4,8000),
(5,5,10000);

3) Select the ID and names of all the suppliers.

SELECT SID,SNAME FROM SUPPLIER;

4) Select the most costly part available in the catalog.

SELECT SID,COST FROM CATALOG WHERE
COST = (SELECT MAX(COST) FROM CATALOG);

5) Find the pnames of parts for which there is some supplier.

SELECT P.PNAME FROM PART P,SUPPLIER S,CATALOG C
WHERE S.SID = P.PID AND C.SID = P.PID;

6) Find the sids of suppliers who supply a red part and a green part.

SELECT S.SID FROM SUPPLIER S,PART P,CATALOG C
WHERE S.SID = P.PID AND C.SID = P.PID AND P.COLOR IN ('RED','GREEN');

ADDITIONAL QUERIES

1) Find the sids of suppliers who supply a red part or a green part.

SELECT SUPPLIER.SID FROM SUPPLIER
JOIN CATALOG
ON SUPPLIER.SID = CATALOG.SID
JOIN PART
ON PART.PID = CATALOG.PID
WHERE PART.COLOR IN ('RED','GREEN');

2) List the suppliers residing in Bangalore.

SELECT SID,SNAME FROM SUPPLIER WHERE ADDRESS = 'BANGLORE';

3) Find the sids of suppliers who supply red parts

SELECT SUPPLIER.SID,PART.COLOR FROM SUPPLIER
JOIN CATALOG
ON SUPPLIER.SID = CATALOG.SID
JOIN PART
ON PART.PID = CATALOG.PID
WHERE PART.COLOR = 'RED';

4) For every supplier that supplies a green part and a red part, print the name and price of the most expensive part that he/she supplies.

SELECT S.SNAME,P.PNAME,P.COLOR,C.COST AS 'MAXIMUM COST' FROM SUPPLIER S,PART P,CATALOG C
WHERE S.SID = C.SID AND P.PID = C.PID AND P.COLOR IN ('RED','GREEN') 
ORDER BY C.COST DESC LIMIT 2;
